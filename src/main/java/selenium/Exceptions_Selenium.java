*********StaleElementReferenceException***********
		
		Say ‘id’ of a username field is ‘username_1’ and the XPath will be //*[@id=’firstname_1?]. 
		When you open the page again the ‘id’ might change say to ‘’firstname _11’. 
		In this case, the test will fail because the WebDriver could not find the element. 
		In this case, StaleElementReferenceException will be thrown.
				
		StaleElementReferenceException is thrown when an object for a particular web element was created in the program without any problem and however; 
		this element is no longer present in the window. This can happen if there was a

		Navigation to another page
		DOM has refreshed
		A frame or window switch
		WebElement firstName = driver.findElement(By.id(“firstname”));
		
		driver.switchTo().window(Child_Window);
		
		element.sendKeys(“Aaron”);
		
		In the code above, object firstName was created and then the window was switched. 
		Then, WebDriver tries to type ‘Aaron’ in the form field. In this case StaleElementReferenceException is thrown.
