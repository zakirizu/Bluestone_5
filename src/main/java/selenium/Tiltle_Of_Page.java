 * driver.close - This method closes the browser window on which the focus is set. Despite the familiar name for this method, WebDriver does not implement the AutoCloseable interface.

driver.quit – This method basically calls driver.dispose a now internal method which in turn closes all of the browser windows and ends the WebDriver session gracefully.

driver.dispose - As mentioned previously, is an internal method of WebDriver which has been silently dropped according to another 
answer - Verification needed. This method really doesn't have a use-case in a normal test workflow as either of the previous methods should work for most use cases.
